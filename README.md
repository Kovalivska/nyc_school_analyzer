**Production-ready NYC High School Directory Analysis Tool**

A comprehensive, enterprise-grade Python application for analyzing NYC high school data with advanced statistical analysis, professional visualizations, and exportable insights.

## Overview

NYC School Analyzer transforms the raw Jupyter notebook analysis into a scalable, maintainable production system. This project originated from a comprehensive 4-day data analysis internship program that demonstrates proficiency in data exploration, Python programming, SQL database operations, and ETL processes using real NYC educational datasets.

The production system provides:

- **Professional Data Processing**: Robust ETL pipeline with validation and error handling
- **Advanced Analytics**: Statistical analysis, trend identification, and comparative studies  
- **Publication-Quality Visualizations**: Charts and dashboards ready for presentations
- **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV, JSON, Excel, PDF reports with automated generation
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for batch processing and automation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks
- **Production Deployment**: Docker support, logging, monitoring, and CI/CD ready

## 4-Day Analysis Project Foundation

This production tool is built upon comprehensive analysis work completed across 4 focused days:

### Day 1: Data Exploration and Google Sheets Analysis
**Dataset**: School Safety Report Data (data/1_school-safety-report.csv)
**Notebook**: notebooks/1_School_incident_Analysis(GoogleSheet).md

**Results**: Analyzed 6,310 school safety incidents across 1,893 unique schools. Identified "nocrim_n" as the most frequent incident type (28.2% in Bronx). Discovered that Brooklyn and Bronx represent 61% of all violent crimes, with correlation between building size and incident frequency.

### Day 2: Python Data Analysis with Pandas  
**Dataset**: NYC High School Directory (data/2_3_high-school-directory.csv)
**Notebook**: notebooks/2_NYC_school_directory_exploration_analysis_v2(prod).ipynb

**Results**: Processed 435 high schools with 69 attributes each. Brooklyn identified as largest borough with 121 schools (27.8% of total). Analyzed student population distribution showing average 699 students per Brooklyn school. Implemented comprehensive data cleaning pipeline with 100% validation success.

### Day 3: SQL Database Operations via Python
**Datasets**: High School Directory, School Demographics, School Safety Report 
**Notebook**: notebooks/3_NYC_school_data_exploration(SQL_via_Python).ipynb

**Results**: Executed multi-table JOIN queries across normalized database tables. Confirmed school distribution: Brooklyn (121), Bronx (118), Manhattan (106), Queens (80), Staten Island (10). Identified data quality issues with ELL demographic data and incomplete special education coverage.

### Day 4: ETL Pipeline and Data Integration
**Dataset**: NYC SAT Results (data/4_sat-results.csv)  
**Notebook**: notebooks/4_SAT_modeling_database_population_v3(prod).ipynb
**Output**: outputs/4_cleaned_sat_results.csv, outputs/4_data_integration_summary.md

**Results**: Implemented comprehensive data quality improvements including score validation, format standardization, and duplicate removal. Generated statistical analysis showing average 1,209 total SAT score with 87% testing participation across NYC schools.

processor = DataProcessor()
analyzer = SchoolAnalyzer(config=config.analysis)

# Custom analysis workflow
school_data = processor.process_dataset("data.csv")
brooklyn_schools = processor.filter_by_borough(school_data.processed_data, "QUEENS")

# Advanced analytics
metrics = analyzer.metrics_calculator.calculate_comprehensive_metrics(
    brooklyn_schools, 
    target_grade=10
)

insights = analyzer.insight_generator.generate_comparative_insights(
    current_analysis=metrics,
    historical_data=previous_metrics
)
```

# Process multiple files
for file in data/*.csv; do
  nyc-schools analyze "$file" --output-dir "results/$(basename $file .csv)"
done

  jq '.executive_summary' > summary.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Errors with Large Datasets**
```bash
# Use chunked processing
export NYC_SCHOOLS_CHUNK_SIZE=5000
nyc-schools analyze data/2_3_high-school-directory.csv
```

**Visualization Rendering Issues**
```bash
# Use non-interactive backend
export MPLBACKEND=Agg
nyc-schools viz outputs/data/processed_data_*.csv
```

**Configuration Validation Errors**
```bash
# Check configuration
nyc-schools config

# Validate specific config file (if available)
nyc-schools validate data/2_3_high-school-directory.csv
```
